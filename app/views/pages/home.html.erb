      This is my web app developed in Ruby on Rails using PostgreSQL database! I want to record here the incredible moments of my life. You'll find photos of my tours and of my friends.

      I was a street dog from Nova Iguaçu (RJ) and liked to eat swiss bread. During 2020 I was adopted and now I receive a lot of love, living a playboy life in Niterói (RJ). But I had to stop eating swiss bread and today I only eat premium food. I really like walking in Campo de São Bento and in Moreira César Street. See you around!
